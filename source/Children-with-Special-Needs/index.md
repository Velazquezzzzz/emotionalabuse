## The Impact of Emotional Abuse on Children with Special Needs (ASD)
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face unique challenges when they are subject to emotional abuse. Because of their mental, social, and emotional distinctions, they are more susceptible to the negative effects of such mistreatment. One significant factor has an impact on their social and emotional growth. Because children with autism often conflict with social interaction and feeling recognition, exposure to emotional abuse, such as rejection, censure, or confinement, is more weakens these abilities. According to Green and colleagues (2018), early childhood emotional abuse is related to a decline in social and emotional skills. Children with autism who presently struggle with these areas may find interpersonal relationships to be even more hard. This generally causes more isolation and social anxiety.

## Impact on Brain Development
The impact on brain development is another important problem because emotional abuse occurs early in life along with significant brain development, particularly in the cerebral cortex and limbic program, which are responsible for emotional regulation, interest, and memory (Hawkins, 2022). These mental regions are now growing differently than neurotypical children with autism. Additionally, giving in to emotional abuse may lead to worsening private reactions, increased anxiety, and problems with wanting power. Students with ASD's regular sensory perceptions may be affected by these fundamental changes. People with ASD may find regular schoolwork to be more challenging and emotionally draining as a result.

## Impact on Social and Emotional Development
Children with autism may go through serious outcomes from emotional abuse, according to the school. These children often rely on constructed, time-consuming environments to support their learning. Emotional abuse introduces weakness and confusion, which increases anxiety and reduces the child's ability to focus on training, at al. Children with developmental vulnerabilities, including those who have ASD, are more likely to experience delays in social maturity and maturity. This may cause them to have trouble following instructions, have physical problems, and refrain from participating in group activities, which may negatively impact their studying experience. As a result, those with disabilities who are content with emotional abuse are more likely to fight on a professional level and give up on studying.
