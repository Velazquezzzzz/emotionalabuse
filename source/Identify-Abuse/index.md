# How to Identify Signs of Emotional Abuse in Children and Young People
Children experiencing emotional abuse often reveal specific characteristics and signals that can help educators, caregivers, and professionals identify their situation. Emotional abuse manifests in various forms, such as rejection, isolation, terrorizing, ignoring, and corrupting behaviors from caregivers. According to Briggs (2012), “Rejection acts which amount to the emotional abandonment of the child such as a failure to show affection,” are one of the most evident signs of emotional abuse. The behaviour of rejection can make children feeling unworthy and unloved, which directly affects their self-esteem and social interactions.

Isolation is another key indicator, where a child is deliberately prevented from participating in social activities or normal peer interactions. Such actions create barriers to the development of healthy relationships and can lead to feelings of loneliness and alienation. Additionally, emotional abuse can affect brain development, especially in areas responsible for emotional regulation and social connections. Hawkins (2022) explains that during childhood, the brain undergoes critical periods of growth, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which governs impulse control, decision-making, and emotional regulation. Exposure to emotional abuse during these stages can hinder this development, leaving children more susceptible to anxiety and difficulty focusing on school.

Ignoring, which involves a caregiver failing to respond to the child’s emotional needs, is also a significant characteristic of emotional abuse. When children’s needs for attention and affection are not met, they may become withdrawn or act out in frustration to seek recognition. Corrupting behaviors, such as encouraging children to adopt inappropriate or harmful habits, further demonstrate how emotional abuse can undermine a child’s moral and psychological development.

Children who have experienced emotional abuse may exhibit odd symptoms like low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, violent conduct, and trouble making friends. These children may exhibit an overpowering need for adult approval or have trouble focusing in class. "Continuous and repeated verbal criticisms and 'putting down' might accumulate over time to significantly affect self-esteem and well-being," according to Briggs (2012).
