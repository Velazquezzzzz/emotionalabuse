# How Emotional Abuse Affects Children’s Development and Education
It is no doubt that emotional abuse has profound implications for the healthy development and educational outcomes of children and young people. One of the most important influences is on brain development, particularly in areas related to emotional regulation, memory, and decision-making. Early childhood is particularly susceptible to the consequences of emotional maltreatment because the brain's degree of neuroplasticity is very high (Green et al., 2018). During this stage, the prefrontal cortex—which controls self-control and cognitive flexibility—develops quickly. Self-regulation issues, impulsive conduct, and emotional outbursts can result from exposure to emotional abuse, such as persistent rejection or criticism, which can disrupt the development of brain connections (Hawkins, 2022). Children's capacity to adjust to classroom norms and procedures may be adversely affected by these developmental problems.

Chronic stress, such as living in fear because of emotional abuse, causes hyperactivation of the amygdala, the brain's "fear center." This overactivation boosts the production of stress hormones like cortisol, which, if prolonged, may impair the development of the hippocampus—an area crucial for memory and learning (Green et al., 2018). Consequently, children who have experienced emotional abuse may show poor working memory and trouble recalling facts in class, lowering their academic performance (Briggs, 2012). The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW, 2020) also attach importance to how negative childhood experiences, such as emotional abuse, increase the risk of developmental vulnerabilities. In summary, children who have experienced emotional abuse may have difficulty concentrating, be hypervigilant, and demonstrate avoidant behavior, which hampers learning.

Emotional abuse also affects children’s social and emotional development. According to Armfield et al. (2021), children who experience maltreatment, including emotional abuse, are more likely to demonstrate vulnerabilities in multiple developmental domains, including social competence and emotional maturity. Children who lack emotional maturity may find it difficult to build relationships with their teachers and peers, which might hinder their ability to learn and make friends. Also, this type of social isolation can impair students' sense of belonging at school, which contributes to academic disengagement.

The long-term impacts on education are more problematic. According to Green (2018), children being emotionally abused are likely to have lower grades, repeat school years, and drop out of school. Emotional abuse has also been associated to higher absenteeism, since children may escape school environments in which they feel socially alienated or struggle to satisfy academic requirements. Longitudinal research by Armfield et al. (2021) discovered that only 51.2% of children at high risk of maltreatment displayed resilience in their educational setting. Children who were read to at home demonstrated increased educational resilience, indicating that favorable home circumstances can operate as a protective factor (Armfield et al., 2021).
